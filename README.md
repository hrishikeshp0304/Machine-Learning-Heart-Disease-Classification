# Machine-Learning-Heart-Disease-Classification

The main goal of this project is to develop a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict the absence (0) or presence (1) of heart disease being suffered by the patient using information on 13 physiological attributes. Several different machine learning algorithms are assessed and the algorithm which is best-suited for this dataset is finally chosen.
